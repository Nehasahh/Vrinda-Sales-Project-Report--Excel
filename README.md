# Project: Vrinda Sales Analysis - 2023

# Objective:
Vrinda Store aimed to analyze its annual sales performance for 2023, with the goal of uncovering customer behavior patterns, identifying sales trends, and generating strategic recommendations to boost sales in 2024. I took the lead in performing this analysis, using Excel for data cleaning, manipulation, segmentation, and visualization to craft an interactive and dynamic dashboard that delivered key insights.

# Steps Involved:

# Data Cleaning and Preparation:
The raw sales data was cleaned to remove duplicates, correct errors, and handle any missing or inconsistent entries. 
Key data cleaning tasks included:
* Standardizing the data formats for sales dates, order status, customer details, and sales platforms.
* Handling missing values in critical columns, ensuring data integrity before analysis.

# Data Manipulation:
Several new columns were created to enhance analysis and segmentation:
* Age Group Column: The original age column was segmented into three groups: Teen (13-19 years), Adult (20-49 years), and Senior (50+ years) to analyze purchasing behavior across different age ranges.
* Month Column: Extracted the month from the sales date column to allow trend analysis on a month-by-month basis, enabling easier visualization of sales and orders.

# Data Segmentation:
To better target customer demographics and understand product preferences, I segmented the data into several key categories, including:
* Gender (Male vs. Female)
* Sales Channels (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra, Ajio, etc.)
* States (to track performance in different regions, especially the top-performing states)

# Dashboard Creation and Visualization:
After preparing the data, I developed an interactive Excel dashboard with the following visualizations and features:

* Line and Bar Chart (Combined): This visual showcased the number of orders placed each month, alongside the corresponding sales, allowing for a month-to-month comparison of orders and revenue.
* Slicers for Filtering: Added slicers to filter the dashboard based on months, channels (such as Ajio, Amazon, Flipkart), product categories, and age groups, providing flexibility to view data through different lenses.
* Pie Chart for Gender Distribution: Created a pie chart to represent the male vs. female customer base, clearly showing that women accounted for 64% of the customer base.
* Pie Chart for Order Status: Visualized the distribution of order statuses (e.g., delivered, returned, canceled, refunded) to assess operational efficiency and areas for improvement.
* Clustered Bar Chart: This chart displayed orders based on gender and age group, giving insights into which demographics placed the most orders.
* Column Chart for Top 5 States: Highlighted the top 5 performing states in terms of total sales, with Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh leading the sales figures.
* Donut Chart for Sales by Channel: Created a donut chart to illustrate sales distribution across various channels, with Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra dominating the sales.

# Key Insights Derived:

* Customer Demographics: 
Women represent approximately 64% of the customer base, highlighting a significant trend toward female shoppers. The adult age group (20-49 years) accounted for around 75% of total sales, indicating that this demographic was the most active in terms of purchasing.

* Geographical Trends:
Sales were heavily concentrated in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh, suggesting these regions should be focal points for future marketing campaigns and promotions.

* Sales Channels:
The majority of orders came from Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra, making these platforms crucial for driving future sales strategies.

* Order Status:
A deep dive into the order status revealed areas for improvement in order fulfillment and return rates, which could be optimized to reduce cancellations and improve customer satisfaction.

# Strategic Recommendations:
Based on the insights derived, I recommended that Vrinda Store:

Target Women Aged 20-49 in the top-performing regions (Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh) with tailored promotions to boost engagement and sales.
Leverage Key Platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, Myntra) by optimizing product listings, ads, and customer offers on these channels.
Improve Order Fulfillment and Returns Management to reduce cancellations and refunds, which could help increase profitability and customer satisfaction.
