# Vrinda-Sales-Project-Report

# Objective 
Vrinda Store set out to create a detailed annual sales report for 2022, aiming to uncover deep insights into customer behavior, identify key sales trends, and refine sales strategies for an even more successful 2023. I led the project by performing data analysis, including data cleaning, manipulation, and segmentation. I used pivot charts and tables to highlight key patterns. I also conducted trend forecasting and customer segmentation to offer strategic recommendations. The final result was an interactive and visually compelling Excel dashboard, packed with insights and actionable strategies, designed to help Vrinda Store boost sales and better target its key markets.
